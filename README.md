## How to contribute:
There's some things that I'd like to add to this project:
- [ ] Don't allow to repeat products names;
- [ ] Automate the file main.py to run daily, probably with chronotab or something else;
- [ ] Add more sites to the program;
- [ ] Tests, preferable made with pytest.

Feel free to change the way of showing the results.
